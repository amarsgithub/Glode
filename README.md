# Glode
React-Native based Code Compiler

## Inspiration 

Many people around the world don't have the privilage of owning a working computer but have the passion and the drive to learn about programming. As much as one can practice on whiteboards or paper, there is no device out there to make sure that code is running efficiently. Glode gives people the ability to compile their code and progress on their programming skills all with just one picture of their code.

## What it does 

Extrapalates code from an image taken of code and gives you the output of the code/let's you know what the error(s) is.

## How we built it 

Initially visualizing our product/vision through whiteboarding, then sketching out the UI and discussing the features on a deeper basis, and lastly, implementing these ideas in code utilizing JavaScript. The tech stack of this project included Express, React Native, Node.js, and OCR API's. 

## Challenges 

Finding a proper Optical Character Recognition API and building a functional user interface to allow the user to double-check/edit code before compiling it.

## Accomplishments 

Getting more exposure to AI and OPR. As well as practicing UI development and gaining new knowledge in JavaScript.

## What we learned 

There are multiple ways to develop and create a product despite obstacles on certain platforms causing delay in product development.

## What's next for Glode 

To incorporate user integration, better API performances, and industry advertisement.
