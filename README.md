# Glode
React-Native based Code Compiler
## Inspiration Many people around the world don't have the privilage of owning a working computer but have the passion and the drive to learn about programming. As much as one can practice on whiteboards or paper, there is no device out there to make sure the code is running efficiently. Glode gives people the ability to compile their code and progress on their programming skills all with just the click of a button with your camera.

## What it does Extrapalates code from an image taken of code and gives you the output of the code/let's you know what the error is

## How we built it Initially visualizing our product/vision through whiteboarding, then sketching out the UI and discussing the features on a deeper basis, and lastly, implementing out ideas utilizing JavaScript. The tech stack of this project included Express, React Native, Node.js, and OCR API. 

## Challenges Finding a proper Optical Character Recognition API and building a functional user interface to allow the user to double-check/edit code before compiling it

## Accomplishments 

## What we learned There are multiple ways to develop and create a product despite obstacles on certain platforms causing delay in product development.

## What's next for Glode To gather customer data to enhance company's market insights and demographics. In addition, to also be able to apply its functionalities to other brands and products under CBrands such as its Cannabis Endeavours across the border.
